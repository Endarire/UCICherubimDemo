    <center><h1>The History of <i>CHERUBIM</i>'s Game Development</h1></center>
    <pre><h2>Preface</h2></pre>
    <p>
      As a game, <i>Cherubim</i> has been in development as a personal project and project among friends since late 2005.  Many release dates, projected and actual combined, for the demo and full game have been set but I eventually set a new date of, 'When it's ready."  (This is the <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/">Blizzard Entertainment</a> philosophy for its games.)  The main obstacle to <i>Cherubim</i>'s release has been a lack of programming help:  Making a game that, mechanically, is not at least very close to direct clone of another game has required more technical expertise and input than anyone on the team has thus far contributed.
      <br/><br/>
      <i>Cherubim</i>'s scope and intent have changed over the course of its many-year development cycle.  Initially, it was meant as a humorous plot-light parody game that emphasized angels making fun of <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames">video game tropes</a>.  It has since expanded to be more than a mere parody, though there is still plenty of humor.
      <br/><br/>
      For many years, I billed <i>Cherubim</i> as a mix of <a href="http://www.crazygames.com/game/html5-lemmings"><i>Lemmings</i></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IelHCb7iEIg"><i>Disgaea</i></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT--dCvJNJs"><i>The Incredible Machine</i></a> due to its initial mechanics of assigning classes to angels like in <i>Lemmings</i>, its cartoony supernatural aesthetics like in <i>Disgaea</i>, and its wacky, Rube Goldbergian nature in certain segments; however, as I meditated furhter on the game's premise and received helpful feedback from schoolmates, friends, and family, it became much more apparent that this game needed a focus beyond mere dreams and ideas.
      <br/><br/>
      Below is an approximate timeline of major events in <i>Cherubim</i>'s development history thus far.  Since the initial inspiration, he has pondered how what he has experienced - such as games and conventions - related to <i>Cherubim</i>.

    <pre><h2><i>Cherubim</i>: The Game, The Timeline</h2></pre>
    <p>
    <h3><b>October-November, 2005</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>While Greg attended <a href="http://www.fullerton.edu/">Cal State Fullerton</a> (CSUF), he had a dream of a video game where anime/cartoon angels with gold hair in white robes rode minecarts underground; shot green projectiles from laser pistols in a blue, wet cavern; and rode merry-go-rounds in grassy or cloud settings.  That was likely his best day yet to miss school due to feeling icky.</li>
      <li>Greg gathered information from his CSUF Game Design course about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA">Microsoft's XNA</a>, a game creation tool that seemed popular at the time.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3><b>January, 2006</b></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Greg started learning XNA.  Game creation-wise, he got as far as his first blue screen (of death?).  He was otherwise focused on finishing <a href="https://campbellgrege.com/work-listing/fate-and-destiny-starcrafts-turn-based-rpg/">Fate and Destiny RPG</a> a multiplayer turn-based RPG for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/19/15354716/starcraft-free-download-pc-mac"><i>StarCraft: Brood War</i></a>'s real time strategy game engine.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>Some Time In Here</b></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greg was inspired for <i>Cherubim</i>'s character classes of Basic Cherub (iconic characters: Im & Tony), Engineer Cherub (iconic character: Bob the Builder who much later became Adelle), Athlete Cherub (iconic character: Russel), Mystic Cherub/Healer Cherub (iconic character: Raphael), Warrior Cherub (iconic character: Rockwell), Demolitions Cherub (iconic character: Bombshell), and Artist Cherub (iconic character: Pastel).</li>
      <li>The character personalities became more solidified during this time.  Im, the game's main character, was also the game's primary personality, focused on playfulness, fun, and fourth wall breaks while Im's twin brother Tony would eventually act as Im's more serious counterpart.  The iconic Engineer Cherub had an initial personality of cowardly inside but collected outside, but this would eventually change.  Raphael's initial personality was a lot more severe, and as a mystic/medic, he had witnessed the horrors of demonic corruption.  Pastel's personality was largely undefined due to him scheduling to appear near the game's end.</li>
      <li>Joke rating screens were likely first devised during this time.</li>
      <li>Crafting was considered for this game, especially as an ability for Engineers.  It would eventually be scrapped due to feeling out of place.</li>
      <li>The game's main worlds (Cloud City Nimbia; Underground; Airship Infinity; Space/Starbase 9FOS; "Where Are We?"/Rainbow Row; and The Abyss) were devised during this time; however, there was no logical flow to these worlds.</li>
      <li>Greg attended a conference where someone made a game with gameplay heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/3/5678044/the-lost-vikings-free-blizzard-deal"><i>The Lost Vikings</i></a>, even calling it by that name, but with more Mexican aesthetics.</li>
      <li>At the 2008 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_for_All">E for All Conference</a>, Greg pitched the idea for <i>Cherubim</i> to at least one booth holder there.  This pitch started with the line, "Angels.  Cute, <i>adorable</i> angels.  Beings... with entirely too much time on their hands."  This pitch also involved angels using jetpacks, shooting laser pistols riding merry-go-rounds, and piloting power armor to return the angels to their heavenly home.  None of the other pitchees seemed interested in developing it.</li>
      <li>The Power Armor vehicle was likely devised during this time.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>November, 2008</b></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>At <a href="http://www.fullerton.edu/">Cal State Fullerton</a>, Greg attended a tournament for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl"><i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i></a> where he met <a href="https://www.facebook.com/becky.beal.9">Becky Beal</a>, an artist that provided some concept art and further inspiration for <i>Cherubim</i>.</li>
      <li>Becky and Greg met occasionally during this time and afterward to discuss game details.  The initial appearances for the 8 aforementioned iconic angels were devised or/and more solidified during this time.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>October, 2010</b></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greg got the first version of his Im costume and wore it to a Halloween party with people from the video gaming industry.  He occasionally talked with partygoers about <i>Cherubim</i>, including someone dressed as Captain Hammer from <i>Dr. Horrible's Singalong Blog</i>.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>July, 2011</b></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greg attended a Game Development and Content Creation course at <a href="https://www.ucr.edu/">UCR, the University of California-Riverside</a> where he dressed as Im for a <i>Cherubim</i> final presentation.  At UCR, he was also inspired with the sequence of the worlds:  Start in Nimbia, head underground, return to the sky, prepare the Airship Infinity for battle and meet the demonic enemy, take the fight to the demons in their starbase, teleport to the Abyss (but be interrupted by a rainbow world that visually references <a href="https://www.elizium.nu/scripts/lemmings/"><i>Lemmings</i></a>, then the Abyss for real this time.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>Mid-2012</b></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greg was employed as a Video Game Designer at the now-defunct ParallelPorta wherehe seriously considered proposing <i>Cherubim</i> as a project for the company.  He's glad he didn't.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>Late 2013</b></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greg met with his friend John Kirkconnell to discuss <i>Cherubim</i>.  They prayed that this game would be Christ-exalting.</li>
      <li>.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>February, 2014</b></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greg attended Full Sail University in Florida and intended to do <i>Cherubim</i> as a long-term project.  Due to his Game Design course, serious discussions about the game began with his classmates.</li>
      <li>Greg made an interaction chart for the game's mechanics.  In layman's terms, this chart was a spreadsheet that explained what happened when each mechanic (like shooting a laser pistol) interacted with each other mechanic (like a mirror or an enemy).</li>
      <li>During a class presentation, Greg repeatedly mentioned how <i>Cherubim</i>'s mechanics were like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IelHCb7iEIg"><i>Disgaea</i></a>.  Joseph Mahler, one of his classmates, mentioned that Greg seemed to be (re)making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IelHCb7iEIg"><i>Disgaea</i></a> which prompted Greg to seriously consider <i>Cherubim</i>'s mechanics.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>Summer, 2014</b></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greg recruited some of his friends in California to aid him in making <i>Cherubim</i> in earnest.</li>
      <li>Greg started learning <i>Game Maker Studio</i> so his team (Team Angel) may also learn it.</li>
      <li>Greg learned a <i>lot</i> about independent game creation during this time including why people normally need a 4+ year undergraduate degree before programming something of such a caliber.</li>
      <li><i>Cherubim</i> progress halts due to time running out.  Game creation progress is stalled with few assets made, but nothing digitally playable.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>Mid-2015</b></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Having graduated Full Sail in December, 2014, Greg returned to writing design documentation for <i>Cherubim</i>.  He asked for programming assistance from certain other programming friends.  Some offered advice.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>April & May, 2018</b></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greg began writing the game's story mode script on Google Drive.  While he had planned some of it mentally for years, a plane ride from Seattle to California seemed like an apt time to write it to paper then later to The Internet.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>October, 2018</b></h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>At UCI (<a href="https://uci.edu/">University of California, Irvine</a>), during his web development boot camp, Greg started relearning <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> to make <i>Cherubim</i> as a 2D game with mechanics similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Four_Swords_Adventures"><i>Four Swords Adventures</i></a>.  This final project was meant to be a single level, akin to a digitally-playable version of <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xTeKUESuADgW3fK3wd8lB4QEeMzgEOAA">this sample level</a>.</li>
      <li>Progress was again halted due to needing to learn Unity and produce something worthwhile.  (Having only about 2 weeks to work part-time to learn Unity, create this demo, and make a React.js website was too much work, even with purchased Unity extensions.)  At least online tutorials and tools have improved in the past few years.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><b>Post-October,  2018</b></h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Get hired.</li>
      <li>Finish <i>Cherubim</i> script.</li>

      <li>Release game to worldwide acclaim.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
