    <p>
      Make these levels (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xTeKUESuADgW3fK3wd8lB4QEeMzgEOAA">#1</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qBNymxcjctWkBZ8w1CoOEe49Ygmh8AAz">#2</a>) with <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nXDL7HLKSLrqRpq8vC0WE960OEb90jCj">these rules</a> fully playable in <a href="http://unity3D.com">Unity2D</a>.
      <br/><br/>
      These levels are of similar difficulty to those at or near the start of the game's third chapter.  The levels require using all angels for their special abilities.

    <pre><h2>Methods and Tools</h2></pre>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMn0XGz_9-4&list=PLKbLeHr54LXcsb8oSB8zJSEqjGywpmtVg">this YouTube video series</a> from Let's Code Games.</li>
      <li>Ask for advice on the <a href="https://forum.unity.com/">Unity forums</a>, such as with <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/moving-a-character-in-a-top-down-2d-game.572161/">this thread</a>.</li>
      <li>Acquire <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/10037">Unity Asset Store assets</a> for use with <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, largely via <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a>.</li>
      <br/>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <pre><h2>Notable Obstacles</h2></pre>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Large project scope.  Unity is a robust, complex program with a steep set of learning curves.  To even make a character face south and have a separate south-facing walk animation required about a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMn0XGz_9-4">42-minute video</a>.  Making a game that allows the first 5 minutes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5o94LV5gG0">this <i>Zelda III</i> video</a> requires making much - or even the majority of - the game's systems.</li>
      <li>Significant time crunch!  Making this game demo in 13 days or thereabouts, even with full-time work, would likely be a challenge for a skilled Unity engine programmer.  This time frame was also far less than full-time.</li>
      <li>This game's development is meant to be more than a 1-man show.  Even with prior team members contributing advice, assets, and encouragement, making this engine is a non-trivial set of tasks.</li>
